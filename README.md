###### This is the example project of implementing MVVM with clean architecture.

## Model View View Model (MVVM)
MVVM is a software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls. MVVM is also known as model-view-binder and was created by Microsoft architects Ken Cooper and John Gossman.

## Why MVVM with Clean Architecture?
MVVM separates your view (i.e. Activitys and Fragments) from your business logic. MVVM is enough for small projects, but when your codebase becomes huge, your ViewModels start bloating. Separating responsibilities becomes hard.
